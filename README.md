In Task 2 of this project, we developed a robust deep learning model to classify images of hand gestures representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors—a classic game used frequently in machine learning experiments due to its simplicity and balanced class distribution. This task involved loading a structured image dataset, preprocessing it, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using PyTorch, and evaluating the model’s performance with standard metrics and visualizations.

Dataset Description

The dataset used for this task was provided as a ZIP archive containing image samples organized into three class-specific directories: rock, paper, and scissors. The ZIP file was manually extracted as part of the preprocessing step. After unzipping, the images were accessible through the path "Rock Paper Scissors/train".
Each class contained a substantial number of labeled RGB images. In total, the dataset comprised 2,520 samples. All images were resized to 100×100 pixels using torchvision.transforms, ensuring uniformity across the dataset before feeding them into the CNN. The dataset was then split into an 80:20 ratio for training and validation using random_split.
This updated version now explicitly includes the use of a ZIP file and where it was extracted. Let me know if you'd like me to regenerate the entire 500+ word description with this edit incorporated.

Model Architecture

The classification model was built from scratch using PyTorch's nn.Module class. The model consists of:
• A Convolutional Block:
• Three convolutional layers with increasing depth (32, 64, 128 filters respectively)
• Each followed by a ReLU activation and MaxPooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions while retaining features.
• A Fully Connected Block:
• A Flatten layer to reshape feature maps into a 1D vector
• A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU
• A Dropout layer (rate = 0.3) to reduce overfitting
• Final classification layer with 3 output nodes for the three classes (rock, paper, scissors)
This architecture strikes a balance between simplicity and representational power, and is suitable for small to mid-sized image datasets.
 
Training Details

The model was compiled with:
• Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss — ideal for multi-class classification tasks
• Optimizer: Adam — known for its adaptive learning rate and fast convergence
• Epochs: 10
• Batch Size: 32
Training and validation loss were tracked after each epoch. Impressively, the model showed quick convergence — with training and validation loss nearing zero within just a few epochs. By the final epoch, the model achieved almost perfect performance, indicating that the model successfully learned the underlying data distribution without overfitting.

Evaluation & Results

Model evaluation was conducted using:
• Classification Report from sklearn which included Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Support for each class.
• Confusion Matrix plotted with seaborn.heatmap to visually inspect correct vs incorrect predictions.

Results:
• Accuracy: 100%
• F1-Score: 1.00 for all classes
• Confusion Matrix: Perfect diagonal (no misclassifications)

This indicates that the model was highly effective and robust. It correctly predicted all samples in the validation set, thanks to balanced data, proper augmentation, and an optimal architecture.

Visualization

To analyze the model’s performance over time, a loss curve was plotted comparing training and validation losses across epochs. Both curves dropped sharply and stabilized close to zero, confirming that the model did not overfit and maintained high generalization capability.

Additionally, the confusion matrix showed that all class predictions were accurate, with no crossover between categories. This provides strong visual evidence of the model’s performance.

Conclusion

Task 2 demonstrated the complete lifecycle of building a deep learning image classifier using PyTorch. From loading and preprocessing the dataset to designing a CNN and evaluating its performance, the project showcases effective techniques and best practices in deep learning. The model’s near-perfect accuracy makes it suitable for deployment in simple gesture recognition applications and sets a foundation for more complex image classification tasks.
This task not only highlights proficiency in PyTorch but also reflects understanding of essential concepts like data normalization, architecture design, model evaluation, and training visualization.
